description: Scaffold a new .NET solution (Web API + Worker microservices) using ONION architecture and EF Core, codifying battle-tested layered patterns and explicitly avoiding the common pitfalls of legacy stored-procedure-centric codebases. Use this skill whenever the user asks to "create a new dotnet project", "scaffold a .NET API", "new C# solution", "add a worker microservice", "add a feature end-to-end", or mentions "ONION", "Clean Architecture", "Onion Architecture", or "the layered .NET patterns I like". Three modes — (1) full solution scaffold, (2) add a feature slice through all layers, (3) add a BackgroundService worker microservice.

# .NET ONION API Scaffolder

Generate a production-grade .NET solution that keeps the **good** layered patterns (Api → Application → Infrastructure → Domain separation, base classes for cross-cutting concerns, extension-method wiring in `Program.cs`, JWT, AutoMapper, auto-DI, unified error responses) and eliminates the **bad** ones often seen in legacy .NET codebases (stored-procedure-centric reflection repositories, EF6 on netstandard2.1, polling console-app workers, swallowed exceptions, mutable per-request state on base service classes, mixed ADO/Dapper/EF6 data access, missing `CancellationToken` plumbing).

## Contract

**Inputs:** Mode (full solution scaffold / feature slice / worker microservice) + feature description; resolved TFM and NuGet versions (looked up at scaffold time, not hard-coded).
**Outputs:** New .NET solution OR a feature slice through Api → Application → Infrastructure → Domain layers OR a `BackgroundService` worker microservice — all following ONION conventions.
**Invokes:** `(none)`
**Invoked by:** User phrases — "create a new dotnet project", "scaffold a .NET API", "new C# solution", "add a worker microservice", "add a feature end-to-end", "ONION / Clean Architecture / Onion Architecture"; called by `plan-and-build` when stack matches.

## When to use this skill

Trigger on any of:

- "create a new dotnet project / .NET solution / C# project"
- "scaffold a .NET Web API"
- "new microservice in .NET" / "add a worker service"
- "use the patterns I like" / "use my layered .NET conventions" (in a .NET context)
- "ONION architecture" / "Clean Architecture" / "layered .NET project"
- "add a feature end-to-end" / "add a slice" (API + service + repository + EF entity + tests)
- The user pastes a feature spec and asks you to wire it through the layers of a .NET solution

If unsure whether the user wants a brand-new solution vs. an addition to an existing one, ask once — don't guess.

## Three operating modes

Pick the mode from the user's request. If ambiguous, ask.

| Mode | Trigger | Output |
|------|---------|--------|
| **`scaffold-solution`** | "new project", "scaffold solution", empty directory | Full ONION solution: Domain, Application, Infrastructure, Api, Workers (optional), Tests. |
| **`add-feature`** | "add `<Entity>` end-to-end", "wire up `<feature>` through all layers" | Entity + EF config + repository (port + adapter) + use-case service + DTO + controller + AutoMapper profile + unit test. |
| **`add-worker`** | "new worker", "add microservice for queue X" | New `Workers.<Name>` project (BackgroundService) referencing Application + Infrastructure, with queue/service-bus consumer and graceful shutdown. |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Determine the target framework (don't hard-code)

The user explicitly does **not** want a hard-coded `<TargetFramework>` baked into the skill. Before generating `.csproj` files:

1. Check the user's environment first: run `dotnet --list-sdks` to see installed SDKs.
2. If a current LTS SDK is installed, prefer the highest installed LTS (`net8.0`, `net10.0`, etc.).
3. If unsure which is the current LTS, fetch the latest .NET support policy via context7 (`mcp__plugin_context7_context7__resolve-library-id` → `query-docs` for ".NET release schedule" / "dotnet support policy") or WebFetch `https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core`. Quote the version you picked back to the user before generating.
4. Pin EF Core, ASP.NET Core, and `Microsoft.Extensions.*` package versions to the **latest stable for that TFM** — look them up via context7 (`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`, etc.) rather than guessing. Never hand-paste a version you don't have a source for.
5. State the chosen TFM and package versions in your reply before writing files, so the user can object before scaffolding.

### Step 2 — Gather inputs (ask once, in one batch)

For `scaffold-solution`, use `AskUserQuestion` to collect:

- **Solution name** (e.g. `Acme.Billing`). Used for namespace root and `.sln`.
- **First feature/entity** (optional, e.g. `Customer`) — if provided, also run `add-feature` for it after scaffold.
- **Auth**: JWT bearer with HS256 (symmetric) **or** JWT with asymmetric (RS256/JWKS) **or** none-yet.
- **Include any Workers now?** If yes, ask for their names (comma-separated, e.g. `EmailSender, PdfPrinter`).
- **Optional extras**: Serilog + OpenTelemetry? Dockerfile? GitHub Actions CI? Testcontainers integration tests? (Default: skip — only add if asked.)

For `add-feature`: entity name, properties (name + C# type + nullability), whether it needs CRUD controller or only specific endpoints.

For `add-worker`: worker name, trigger source (Azure Storage Queue / Service Bus / Timer), message DTO type (if known).

### Step 3 — Generate files

Use the **templates in `references/templates/`** as the source of truth for file contents. Apply these rules:

- Use `Write` for new files. Never use `Edit` on files you're creating fresh.
- Replace all `{{Solution}}`, `{{Feature}}`, `{{Worker}}` placeholders consistently.
- Create directories before files. On Windows shell use PowerShell `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force`.
- After scaffolding, run `dotnet sln add` for every project and `dotnet build` to verify the solution compiles. Report build output to the user.
- Do **not** run `dotnet new` to create the projects — write the `.csproj` and `.cs` files directly from templates so the layout matches exactly.

### Step 4 — Verify and report

- Run `dotnet build` from the solution root. If it fails, fix and rebuild — never leave a broken scaffold.
- Run `dotnet test` if any test project exists.
- Reply with a short summary: solution path, projects created, TFM chosen, package versions, next steps (e.g. "run `dotnet ef migrations add Initial -p src/{{Solution}}.Infrastructure -s src/{{Solution}}.Api`").

## Solution layout (canonical)

See [`references/solution-layout.md`](references/solution-layout.md) for the full tree and dependency rules.

```
{{Solution}}/
  {{Solution}}.sln
  src/
    {{Solution}}.Domain          # entities, value objects, domain events. NO project refs.
    {{Solution}}.Application     # use-case services + ports (interfaces) + DTOs + validators. refs Domain.
    {{Solution}}.Infrastructure  # EF Core DbContext, repository adapters, external clients (Azure, email, auth). refs Application+Domain.
    {{Solution}}.Api             # Controllers, Middleware, Filters, Program.cs. refs Application+Infrastructure.
    {{Solution}}.Workers.<Name>  # BackgroundService microservices. refs Application+Infrastructure.
    {{Solution}}.Contracts       # (optional) public DTOs / API contracts shared with clients.
  tests/
    {{Solution}}.UnitTests       # xUnit + NSubstitute. Tests Application use-cases with mocked ports.
    {{Solution}}.IntegrationTests# WebApplicationFactory + Testcontainers (SQL Server). Real DB + real pipeline.
```

**Dependency rule (enforced):** outer → inner only. Domain has zero project references. Application references Domain only. Infrastructure may reference both. Api/Workers reference Application + Infrastructure but never each other.

## Required code patterns

Use these exact patterns when generating files. Full templates are in `references/templates/`.

### Keep

- **`BaseController`** with `[ApiController]`, `[Route("api/[controller]")]`, `[Authorize]`, injected `IUserContext` — see [`references/templates/base-controller.cs.md`](references/templates/base-controller.cs.md).
- **Base use-case service** with constructor-injected `IUserContext` (no public mutable user property — a common bug in legacy bases).
- **Thin `Program.cs`** that calls only extension methods (`AddApplication`, `AddInfrastructure`, `AddApiServices`, `AddJwtAuth`, `AddSwaggerDocs`, `AddCorsPolicies`). See [`references/templates/program-cs.md`](references/templates/program-cs.md).
- **Auto-registration** via `Scrutor` for ports → adapters (replaces `NetCore.AutoRegisterDi`, modern + maintained). Singletons/options registered explicitly.
- **Strongly-typed `AppSettings` + `ConnectionStrings`** bound via `IOptions<T>` (don't register the raw POCO as singleton — use `services.Configure<T>(...)` and inject `IOptions<T>`).
- **AutoMapper** with assembly scan: `services.AddAutoMapper(typeof(ApplicationAssemblyMarker).Assembly)`.
- **Centralized exception middleware** with env-aware response — see [`references/templates/exception-middleware.cs.md`](references/templates/exception-middleware.cs.md).
- **Unified validation error response** via `InvalidModelStateResponseFactory`.
- **JWT auth wiring** in a `RegisterAuth` extension method.
- **Minimal comments in generated code.** Default to no comments. Only add one when the *why* is non-obvious — a workaround for a specific framework bug (with a link), a subtle invariant the code depends on, a domain rule that isn't visible from the names. Never write XML doc-comment blocks (`/// <summary>...`) on internal members; reserve them for genuinely public API surface that ships to consumers. Never restate *what* the next line does, never leave `// TODO` without an issue link. One short line max — no multi-line comment blocks. Well-named identifiers carry the *what*; comments earn their place only when they carry *why*.

### Eliminate (anti-patterns)

Every one of these is forbidden in generated code. See [`references/anti-patterns.md`](references/anti-patterns.md) for the rationale of each.

- ❌ Stored-procedure-first data access. **Use EF Core with LINQ**; only drop to raw SQL via `FromSqlInterpolated`/`ExecuteSqlInterpolated` for legitimate perf/legacy reasons, and never with reflection-based parameter mapping.
- ❌ `dynamic` / `ExpandoObject` for query parameters.
- ❌ Reflection-based `DataRow → object` mappers. EF Core handles this.
- ❌ EF6 + `netstandard2.1`. Use **EF Core (latest)** on the chosen TFM.
- ❌ Empty `catch {}` blocks. Either handle the exception meaningfully or let it propagate to the middleware.
- ❌ Mutable `public User { get; set; }` on a service base class — request-scoped state belongs in the scoped `IUserContext` only.
- ❌ Polling `while (true) { Task.Delay(5s) }` console-app workers. Use `BackgroundService` with `CancellationToken stoppingToken` and SDK-native receive loops — see [`references/templates/worker-program.cs.md`](references/templates/worker-program.cs.md).
- ❌ Booting hosted services with `serviceProvider.GetService<T>()` in `Program.cs`. Register them via `services.AddHostedService<T>()`.
- ❌ Auto-registering everything as `Scoped` indiscriminately. Use Scrutor's lifetime selectors, and register Azure SDK clients / `IHttpClientFactory` clients / options as singletons explicitly.
- ❌ Newtonsoft.Json + `DefaultContractResolver` (PascalCase). Use **System.Text.Json** with `JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase` by default. Add Newtonsoft only if a specific dependency demands it.
- ❌ Missing `CancellationToken` parameters. Every async public method takes `CancellationToken ct` as the **last** parameter and forwards it.
- ❌ Per-tenant repositories under `Repositories/{TenantName}/`. Multi-tenant behavior goes through a strategy injected via DI, not folder forks.
- ❌ Hard-coded multi-tenant magic fallbacks (e.g. defaulting `ClientId` to a literal string when claims are missing). Multi-tenancy comes from `IUserContext` or fails fast.
- ❌ Commented-out dead code in generated files.
- ❌ Controllers that bypass `BaseController` (consistency is mandatory; if a public endpoint needs `[AllowAnonymous]`, declare it on the action).

## Operating-mode playbooks

### Mode 1 — `scaffold-solution`

1. Pick TFM and package versions per **Step 1**. Quote them.
2. Ask the inputs per **Step 2**. Wait for answers.
3. Generate, in this order:
   1. `.sln` file (use `dotnet new sln -n {{Solution}}` *only* to produce the sln; everything else is hand-written from templates).
   2. `src/{{Solution}}.Domain/` (csproj + `DomainAssemblyMarker.cs` + sample `Entity` base if relevant).
   3. `src/{{Solution}}.Application/` (csproj + assembly marker + `Common/` with `IUserContext`, `Result<T>` if requested, `IUnitOfWork` port, `IRepository<T>` port).
   4. `src/{{Solution}}.Infrastructure/` (csproj + `Persistence/AppDbContext.cs` + `Persistence/EntityConfigurations/` folder + `Persistence/UnitOfWork.cs` + `Auth/UserContext.cs` + `DependencyInjection.cs` with `AddInfrastructure`).
   5. `src/{{Solution}}.Api/` (csproj + `Program.cs` + `Extensions/` folder + `Middlewares/ExceptionHandlerMiddleware.cs` + `Controllers/BaseController.cs` + `appsettings.json`/`appsettings.Development.json`).
   6. `src/{{Solution}}.Workers.<Name>/` per worker requested.
   7. `tests/{{Solution}}.UnitTests/` (csproj + xUnit + NSubstitute + AutoFixture).
   8. `tests/{{Solution}}.IntegrationTests/` (csproj + `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` + `Testcontainers.MsSql`) — only if user asked for it.
4. `dotnet sln {{Solution}}.sln add` every project (one command, all projects).
5. `dotnet build` — must succeed.
6. If a first feature was requested, immediately run **Mode 2** for that entity.
7. Report.

### Mode 2 — `add-feature`

For entity `{{Feature}}` (e.g. `Customer`):

1. **Domain**: `src/{{Solution}}.Domain/{{Feature}}s/{{Feature}}.cs` — POCO entity with a private parameterless ctor for EF, a public ctor for invariants, and behavior methods (avoid anemic models). Add domain events only if asked.
2. **Application**:
   - Port: `src/{{Solution}}.Application/{{Feature}}s/I{{Feature}}Repository.cs` (interface with CRUD methods that take `CancellationToken`).
   - DTOs: `Application/{{Feature}}s/Dtos/{{Feature}}Dto.cs`, `Create{{Feature}}Request.cs`, `Update{{Feature}}Request.cs`.
   - Use-case service: `Application/{{Feature}}s/{{Feature}}Service.cs` + interface `I{{Feature}}Service.cs`. Service depends on `I{{Feature}}Repository`, `IUnitOfWork`, `IMapper`. Pure orchestration — no EF references.
   - AutoMapper profile: `Application/{{Feature}}s/Mapping/{{Feature}}Profile.cs`.
   - FluentValidation validator (only if user asked for FluentValidation; otherwise rely on DataAnnotations + the validation factory).
3. **Infrastructure**:
   - EF configuration: `Infrastructure/Persistence/EntityConfigurations/{{Feature}}Configuration.cs` (implements `IEntityTypeConfiguration<{{Feature}}>`).
   - Repository adapter: `Infrastructure/Persistence/Repositories/{{Feature}}Repository.cs` (implements `I{{Feature}}Repository` using `AppDbContext`).
   - Register the DbSet on `AppDbContext`.
4. **Api**:
   - Controller: `Api/Controllers/{{Feature}}sController.cs` inheriting `BaseController`, injecting `I{{Feature}}Service`. Standard REST endpoints, returning DTOs only.
5. **Tests**:
   - `tests/{{Solution}}.UnitTests/{{Feature}}s/{{Feature}}ServiceTests.cs` — xUnit + NSubstitute, covers the service's happy path + one validation/edge case.

Template for the full slice is in [`references/templates/feature-slice.md`](references/templates/feature-slice.md).

After generating: `dotnet build` then `dotnet test`. Both must pass.

### Mode 3 — `add-worker`

For worker `{{Worker}}` (e.g. `EmailSender`):

1. Create `src/{{Solution}}.Workers.{{Worker}}/`:
   - `csproj` per [`references/templates/worker-csproj.md`](references/templates/worker-csproj.md).
   - `Program.cs` using `Host.CreateApplicationBuilder` per [`references/templates/worker-program.cs.md`](references/templates/worker-program.cs.md).
   - `Worker.cs` — `BackgroundService` subclass; loop driven by `stoppingToken`; respects graceful shutdown.
   - `appsettings.json` + `appsettings.Development.json`.
2. Reference `Application` + `Infrastructure` (never `Api`).
3. Add to `.sln`. `dotnet build`.
4. **No `while (true) { ... await Task.Delay(5s) }`** — use the SDK's receive loop (e.g. `await foreach (var msg in receiver.ReceiveMessagesAsync(stoppingToken))` for Service Bus, or `await queueClient.ReceiveMessagesAsync(maxMessages, ct: stoppingToken)` inside a `while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)` loop).

## NuGet packages (resolve latest stable at scaffold time)

Look these up via context7 — do not hand-paste versions:

**Api project**
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi`
- `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore`
- `AutoMapper.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection` (or `AutoMapper` 13+ which self-registers)
- `Scrutor` (assembly-scanning DI)
- `Serilog.AspNetCore` + `Serilog.Sinks.Console` (only if user opted into Serilog)

**Application project**
- `MediatR` only if user explicitly asks for CQRS; default is plain service classes
- `FluentValidation` only if requested

**Infrastructure project**
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` (PrivateAssets="all")
- `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` (PrivateAssets="all")
- `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`
- `Azure.Storage.Blobs`, `Azure.Storage.Queues`, `Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus` (only if used)

**Worker projects**
- `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`
- Same Azure SDK packages as Infrastructure (only what the worker actually uses)

**Test projects**
- `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk`
- `xunit`, `xunit.runner.visualstudio`
- `NSubstitute` (preferred over Moq — cleaner API, actively maintained)
- `FluentAssertions`
- `Testcontainers.MsSql` (integration tests only)
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing` (integration tests only)

## Verification checklist before reporting "done"

- [ ] `dotnet build` exits 0.
- [ ] `dotnet test` exits 0 (if tests were generated).
- [ ] No `.csproj` references violate the ONION rule (verify with `grep`/`Select-String` for cross-layer `ProjectReference`).
- [ ] No file contains any pattern from the **Eliminate** list.
- [ ] `Program.cs` is under ~50 lines (everything else is in extension methods).
- [ ] Domain project's `.csproj` has zero `<ProjectReference>` entries.

If any check fails, fix before reporting. Don't claim success with a known-broken scaffold.

## Examples

### Example 1: Fresh solution

**User:** "Scaffold a new dotnet API project called `Acme.Billing` using my ONION patterns. Add a `Customer` feature too."

**Claude:**
1. Runs `dotnet --list-sdks`, checks context7 for current LTS, picks (e.g.) `net8.0`.
2. Reports chosen TFM + package versions; waits for confirmation if anything looks off.
3. Asks the Step-2 questions (auth flavor, workers, extras).
4. Generates the full solution + the `Customer` feature slice.
5. Runs `dotnet build` and `dotnet test`.
6. Reports the tree and the EF migration command.

### Example 2: Add a feature

**User:** "Add an `Invoice` feature end-to-end to the existing solution."

**Claude:** Runs Mode 2 only — generates Domain entity, Application port + service + DTOs, Infrastructure config + repository, Api controller, unit test. Builds and tests.

### Example 3: Add a worker

**User:** "Add a worker that processes the `print-jobs` Azure Storage queue."

**Claude:** Runs Mode 3 — generates `Workers.PrintJobs` project with a `BackgroundService` that receives messages with `stoppingToken`, calls into an Application service, deletes on success. Wires it into the .sln. Builds.

## Notes

- **Don't over-engineer**: don't add MediatR, CQRS, MassTransit, Polly, MinimalAPI conversions, Result<T> patterns, or domain events unless the user asks. Pragmatic > pure.
- **Don't rewrite the user's existing codebase** as part of this skill. This skill is for *new* scaffolds, not migrations. If the user wants a migration plan, that's a different conversation.
- **Multi-tenancy**: if the new project needs it, generate a `TenantContext` mirroring `IUserContext` and use EF Core query filters (`HasQueryFilter`) rather than per-tenant repositories.
- **Always quote the TFM and package versions you chose before writing files** — the user explicitly asked not to hard-code them.
