description: Pre-commit SQL code review for uncommitted database changes. Detects antipatterns that cause real production incidents — `sp_send_dbmail` in CATCH blocks (masks the real error as a misleading permission denial), broken retry patterns (`@retry` declared without a surrounding `WHILE` loop), swallowing CATCH blocks (no `THROW`/`RAISERROR`/log), new tables created without a primary key or any index (silent perf-then-deadlock killer), parameter-vs-column type mismatches (8152 truncation risk), `EXEC()` string concatenation without `sp_executesql` parameters (SQL injection), `NOLOCK` in write paths, `UPDATE`/`DELETE` without `WHERE`, cursors without `READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY LOCAL`, hardcoded env values (emails, server names, paths), cross-DB references like `msdb.dbo.*`, missing `SET NOCOUNT ON`, missing `GRANT EXECUTE` on `CREATE PROC`, `BEGIN TRANSACTION` outside `TRY`/`CATCH`, and vestigial control-flow comments hinting at refactor leftovers (e.g. `-- end while loop` with no `WHILE`). Reports findings as `BLOCKER` / `WARN` / `INFO` with `file:line` citations and per-finding fix recommendations. **Never edits SQL** — surfaces findings for human review. Use this skill whenever the user says "/sql-review", "review my SQL", "review the SQL diff", "lint the SQL", "check my SQL changes", "SQL pre-commit check", "audit my stored proc", or "any SQL antipatterns in this diff" — even if they don't explicitly say "SQL review skill". Distinct from `code-review` (general best-practice review) — this carries SQL-specific patterns that surface DB-layer production incidents.

# SQL Review

Review uncommitted SQL changes against a catalog of patterns that cause real production incidents — masked errors, unindexed new tables, silent truncation, SQL injection, deadlock-prone CATCH blocks — and surface findings as recommendations the user can act on, **without editing SQL unprompted**.

## When to use this skill

- "/sql-review" / "review my SQL" / "review the SQL diff"
- "lint the SQL" / "SQL pre-commit check" / "check my SQL changes"
- "audit my stored proc" / "any SQL antipatterns in this diff"
- Before committing a `.sql` change touching a stored procedure, function, or table

Do **not** auto-trigger when the user is asking for a *general* code review on a mixed diff — defer to [`code-review`](../code-review/SKILL.md) for that. This skill is specifically for SQL-heavy diffs where the antipattern catalog applies.

## Hard rule: surface, don't refactor

If you find issues, **do not start editing the SQL**. Produce the findings report first. After delivering it, ask the user per finding: *"Want me to fix #N?"* — and wait for an explicit yes. Pre-authorization ("fix them all") proceeds through the list; absent that, default to ask-per-fix.

SQL changes are particularly sensitive because they often run against production data in a single non-reversible deployment. A drive-by refactor mid-review is more dangerous here than in application code.

## Workflow

1. **Snapshot the SQL diff.** Run in parallel:
   - `git status --short` — see what's modified, staged, untracked.
   - `git diff -- '*.sql'` — unstaged SQL changes.
   - `git diff --staged -- '*.sql'` — staged SQL changes.
   - If user passed an explicit range (e.g. `main..HEAD`), use that instead: `git diff <range> -- '*.sql'`.
2. **Triage files into two buckets:**
   - **New files** (status `A` or `??`) — review the entire file. The whole file is new code; pre-existing antipatterns elsewhere don't apply.
   - **Modified files** (status `M`) — review only the changed hunks. The rest of the file may have legacy antipatterns the user isn't introducing (e.g. existing repos commonly have dozens of SPs with the `sp_send_dbmail`-in-CATCH pattern; flagging all of them on an unrelated edit creates noise).
3. **For each check in [What to check](#what-to-check), look for the pattern** in the relevant scope (whole file for new files, diff hunks for modified files). Use ripgrep — don't try to fully parse SQL.
4. **Categorize each finding** as `BLOCKER` / `WARN` / `INFO` (see [Categories](#categories)).
5. **Cite `file:line`** for every finding. Line numbers come from the diff or the current file content.
6. **Produce the report** in the [Output format](#output-format).
7. **Offer to fix** the suggested findings. Wait for the user's selection before editing.

## Categories

- **`BLOCKER`** — would cause a production incident: silent data loss, masked errors, SQL injection, unindexed table that will grow, broken transaction handling. Fix before commit.
- **`WARN`** — likely a bug or maintenance hazard: NOLOCK in write paths, hardcoded environment values, missing `SET NOCOUNT ON`, cross-DB references. Should fix but won't necessarily incident.
- **`INFO`** — style / convention / hygiene: vestigial comments, cursor defaults, missing `GRANT EXECUTE` where the project's pattern exists.

Lead each finding with the *why*. "This swallows the original error and surfaces a misleading permission denial" beats "add `;THROW;`".

## What to check

Use ripgrep for detection. The patterns below are starting points — adapt to the actual diff text.

### Error-handling antipatterns (BLOCKER class)

1. **`sp_send_dbmail` inside `CATCH`** — masks the real exception with a permission/configuration error when the executing login lacks `EXECUTE` on `msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail`. The real underlying error is silently lost.
   - Pattern: `rg -n -B 20 'sp_send_dbmail' <file>` → check whether the surrounding context is a `BEGIN CATCH`.
   - **Fix:** Replace with `;THROW;` to re-raise, or write the error info to a local log table. Never `sp_send_dbmail` from inside operational SPs.

2. **Broken retry pattern** — `DECLARE @retry INT = N;` exists, but no `WHILE @retry` loop wraps the `TRY`/`CATCH`. The retry variable is decremented in the CATCH but never read, so the SP gives up on the first deadlock instead of retrying.
   - Pattern: `rg -n '@retry' <file>` → confirm there's a matching `WHILE.*@retry` somewhere in the same SP body.
   - **Fix:** Add the missing `WHILE @retry > 0 BEGIN ... END` around the TRY/CATCH, or remove the vestigial variable entirely.

3. **Empty / swallowing `CATCH` blocks** — `BEGIN CATCH ... END CATCH` with no `THROW`, no `RAISERROR`, and no `INSERT INTO <error_log_table>`. Silent failure → silent data loss.
   - Pattern: `rg -n -A 30 'BEGIN CATCH' <file>` → check each match for at least one of `THROW`, `RAISERROR`, or `INSERT INTO`.
   - **Fix:** End the CATCH with `;THROW;` unless there's a deliberate reason to suppress (and document that reason).

4. **`BEGIN TRANSACTION` without `TRY`/`CATCH` + `XACT_STATE` handling** — an error mid-transaction leaves an open transaction on the connection.
   - Pattern: `rg -n 'BEGIN TRAN' <file>` → confirm the same SP has `BEGIN TRY` and `XACT_STATE()` checks in CATCH.
   - **Fix:** Wrap in `BEGIN TRY / BEGIN TRANSACTION ... COMMIT TRANSACTION / END TRY / BEGIN CATCH / IF XACT_STATE() = -1 ROLLBACK; IF XACT_STATE() = 1 COMMIT; ;THROW; / END CATCH`.

5. **Vestigial control-flow comments** — `-- end while loop` with no `WHILE` keyword, `-- retry on deadlock` with no retry loop, etc. Strong signal that a refactor left dead code behind.
   - Pattern: `rg -n -- '-- end (while|for|repeat)' <file>` → check for matching opening keyword.
   - **Fix:** Either restore the missing loop or delete the misleading comment.

### Schema / performance antipatterns (BLOCKER for new tables, WARN otherwise)

6. **New `CREATE TABLE` without a primary key, clustered index, or any index** — heap tables will deadlock-and-table-scan once they grow. This is the exact pattern that caused real production deadlocks.
   - Pattern: `rg -n -A 50 'CREATE TABLE' <file>` → confirm at least one of `PRIMARY KEY`, `CLUSTERED INDEX`, or `CREATE INDEX` exists on that table within the diff or in a sibling file.
   - **Fix:** Add `PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED` on the natural ID column. If the table is append-mostly with no natural ID, add a clustered index on the column the populating SPs filter by in `WHERE`.

7. **Parameter-to-column type-width mismatches** — passing `@x VARCHAR(50)` into a column declared `VARCHAR(3)` causes silent truncation (or runtime error 8152 depending on `ANSI_WARNINGS`).
   - Pattern: cross-reference the SP's `@param VARCHAR(N)` declarations against the target table's column widths. Flag any narrowing.
   - **Fix:** Match widths between parameter and column, or add explicit `LEFT(@x, 3)` truncation at the boundary so it's intentional and visible.

8. **Implicit type conversions in `JOIN` / `WHERE`** — `WHERE intCol = @varcharParam` defeats indexes and produces table scans.
   - Pattern: `rg -n -i 'WHERE\s+\w+\s*=\s*@\w+' <file>` → cross-check parameter type vs. column type.
   - **Fix:** Match the parameter type to the column type. If they're authoritatively different, cast the *parameter*, not the column (casting the column kills the index).

### Security antipatterns (BLOCKER)

9. **Dynamic SQL via string concatenation passed to `EXEC()`** without `sp_executesql @stmt, @params` parameterization — SQL injection.
   - Pattern: `rg -n 'EXEC\s*\(' <file>` → confirm any string-concat dynamic SQL nearby uses `sp_executesql` with parameters, not `EXEC(@strSQL)` with values inlined.
   - **Fix:** Switch to `EXEC sp_executesql @stmt = @strSQL, @params = N'@p1 INT, @p2 VARCHAR(50)', @p1 = @value1, @p2 = @value2;`.

10. **Hardcoded environment-specific values** — email addresses, server names, file paths, IP addresses, connection strings.
    - Pattern: `rg -nE "'[\w.-]+@[\w.-]+\.\w+'|@server_name\s*=\s*'\w+'|\\\\\\\\[\\w.-]+\\\\" <file>` (emails, linked servers, UNC paths).
    - **Fix:** Move env-specific values into a configuration table or pass them as parameters from the application layer.

11. **Cross-database references** — `msdb.dbo.*`, `master.dbo.*`, linked server `[srv].db.dbo.*`. These require permissions that may not exist in all environments (the canonical example: a SP calling `msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail` from a login that lacks EXECUTE on it).
    - Pattern: `rg -n 'msdb\.|master\.dbo\.|\[\w+\]\.\w+\.\w+\.' <file>`.
    - **Fix:** Move the cross-DB call out of operational SPs into infrastructure-owned code. If it must stay, document the required permission in a comment so deployments to new environments include the GRANT.

### Correctness / data-safety antipatterns (BLOCKER)

12. **`UPDATE` or `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause** — almost always a bug; will affect every row.
    - Pattern: `rg -n -B 0 -A 20 'UPDATE\s+\w+' <file>` → confirm a `WHERE` clause is present and not commented out.
    - Pattern: `rg -n -B 0 -A 10 'DELETE\s+FROM' <file>` → same.
    - **Fix:** Add the `WHERE` clause. If "every row" really is intended (TRUNCATE-style), use `TRUNCATE TABLE` and add a comment explaining why.

13. **`NOLOCK` / `READ UNCOMMITTED` inside transactional write paths** — `WITH (NOLOCK)` is fine for ad-hoc reporting reads, but in an `UPDATE`/`INSERT`/`DELETE` SP it can read uncommitted data and corrupt the write.
    - Pattern: `rg -n -i 'NOLOCK|READ UNCOMMITTED' <file>` → check whether the same SP has `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` against the same tables.
    - **Fix:** Remove the hint on tables being modified. Consider `SNAPSHOT` isolation if the goal is to avoid blocking.

14. **`TRUNCATE TABLE` or `DROP` without `IF EXISTS`** in deploy scripts that are supposed to be idempotent (re-runnable). Many repos use flat idempotent `Deploy_*.sql` files where re-runs must not fail on missing objects.
    - Pattern: `rg -n -i 'DROP (TABLE|PROC|FUNCTION|VIEW)' <file>` → confirm `IF EXISTS` or `OBJECT_ID(...) IS NOT NULL` guard.
    - **Fix:** `IF OBJECT_ID('dbo.X', 'U') IS NOT NULL DROP TABLE dbo.X;` or `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dbo.X;` (SQL 2016+).

### Style / convention (WARN/INFO)

15. **Missing `SET NOCOUNT ON`** at the top of a new `CREATE PROC` — causes extra round-trips to the client and breaks some ORM drivers that don't handle row-count messages.
    - Pattern: `rg -n -A 5 'CREATE PROC' <file>` → confirm `SET NOCOUNT ON` appears within the first ~10 lines of the procedure body.
    - **Fix:** Add `SET NOCOUNT ON;` as the first statement after `AS BEGIN`.

16. **Cursors without `READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY LOCAL`** — default cursors are slow and persist beyond the current batch.
    - Pattern: `rg -n 'DECLARE\s+\w+\s+CURSOR\b' <file>` → confirm `READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY LOCAL` (or `FAST_FORWARD`) is specified.
    - **Fix:** `DECLARE c CURSOR READ_ONLY FORWARD_ONLY LOCAL FOR SELECT ...`.

17. **Missing `GRANT EXECUTE` at end of `CREATE PROC`** — only flag when the rest of the repo has a consistent `GRANT EXECUTE ON ... TO <role>` pattern at the end of every SP file. Detect the pattern by sampling a few neighboring `.sql` files; if every existing SP grants to the same role and this new SP doesn't, flag it.
    - Pattern: `rg -n 'GRANT\s+EXECUTE' <file>` → confirm present if the repo convention requires it.
    - **Fix:** Append `GRANT EXECUTE ON [dbo].[<proc>] TO [<app_role>] GO` matching the role the rest of the repo grants to.

## Examples

### Example 1: New stored proc with mixed issues

**User:** "/sql-review"

**Claude:**
- Runs `git diff --staged -- '*.sql'` and `git diff -- '*.sql'` in parallel.
- Finds one new file `Stored Procedures/dbo.usp_NewSave.sql`.
- Spots:
  - `B1` — `BEGIN CATCH` without `;THROW;` (line 88) — swallowing.
  - `B2` — calls `EXEC msdb.dbo.sp_send_dbmail` inside that CATCH (line 92) — masking risk.
  - `W1` — missing `SET NOCOUNT ON` at line 6.
  - `W2` — `WITH (NOLOCK)` on the table being UPDATEd (line 45).
  - `I1` — missing `GRANT EXECUTE` at end of file (the repo's other SPs all end with it).
- Reports, then asks: "Want me to fix B1, B2, W1, W2, I1?"

### Example 2: Adding a new table — the canonical incident pattern

**User:** "review the SQL diff before I push"

**Claude:**
- Spots `Tables/dbo.NewAuditLog.sql` (new file) — `CREATE TABLE` declared but **no PRIMARY KEY, no CLUSTERED INDEX, no CREATE INDEX**.
- Flags as `B1` — "Heap table will table-scan on every read/UPDATE. Once the table grows past a few hundred thousand rows under concurrent writes, SQL Server's optimizer picks parallel plans and the workers deadlock on heap pages — a recurring production incident pattern."
- Fix: "Add `PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (id)` or a clustered index on the lookup column."
- Also flags the SP that populates the new table (`B2` — implicit type conversion `WHERE recordID = @recordID` where the new table's `recordID` is `INT` but the param is declared `VARCHAR`).

### Example 3: Modified existing SP — flag only new badness, not legacy

**User:** "lint the SQL — just the staged hunks"

**Claude:**
- The file `usp_UpdateBigOldSP.sql` is modified but huge. The user's diff added a 20-line block that does `UPDATE dbo.Customers SET ...` without a `WHERE` clause.
- **Only flags the new block's `UPDATE` without `WHERE` as `B1`** — does NOT flag the legacy `sp_send_dbmail` call elsewhere in the file (which was already there before the user's edit).
- Notes in the report footer: "1 pre-existing antipattern observed in this file but outside the diff — flagging suppressed per scope. Full-file audit available on request."

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Trying to parse SQL with a full grammar — use ripgrep on the diff text. The skill is heuristic by design.
- ❌ Flagging every existing antipattern in a modified file. Stay scoped to the diff for modified files; full-file scan only for new files.
- ❌ Editing SQL during the review pass. Report first, **always**.
- ❌ Suggesting autofixes for `BLOCKER` items without asking. SQL deploys to production; user confirmation gates the change.
- ❌ Listing a `nit` when there's a `BLOCKER` next to it. Lead with severity.
- ❌ Hand-wavy findings without `file:line`.
- ❌ Inventing antipatterns not in [What to check](#what-to-check). This is a fixed catalog — extending it is a `write-a-skill` change, not a per-run improvisation.
- ❌ Running on non-SQL files. The skill is `.sql`-scoped; mixed diffs route to `code-review` for the non-SQL parts.
- ✅ Diff-scoped scan for modified files, full scan for new files, findings categorized + cited + offered as fixes.

## Notes

- The check catalog is intentionally finite — 17 checks chosen because each one maps to a real production incident class. Don't try to be a full SQL linter (e.g. SQLFluff or sqlcheck) — those exist and run from CI; this skill is the pre-commit human-pass complement focused on bug classes that linters miss.
- For repos that use flat idempotent `Deploy_*.sql` files (every deploy is a full re-run), check #14 (`DROP` / `TRUNCATE` without `IF EXISTS`) is critical — the deploy will fail on second run otherwise. For repos that use forward-only migrations, this check is lower priority.
- The "broken retry" pattern (check #2) is sneakier than it sounds: a `DECLARE @retry INT = 5;` followed by `SET @retry = @retry - 1;` in CATCH but no `WHILE` loop *looks* like deadlock handling. It isn't. Multiple SPs in real codebases have this bug from removed-loop refactors.
- If the user wants the broader cleanup (refactor every legacy SP in the repo with one of these issues), recommend opening a tracked task rather than doing it in the current review — these fixes ripple through deploy pipelines and need coordinated review.
- This skill composes downstream with [`code-review`](../code-review/SKILL.md) — on a mixed diff (`.cs` + `.sql`), run `code-review` for the application code and `sql-review` for the database changes.
